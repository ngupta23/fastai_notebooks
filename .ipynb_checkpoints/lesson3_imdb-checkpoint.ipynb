       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "  xxmaj stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead . xxmaj at lest they have characters you care about , a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast .,xxbos xxmaj not even the xxmaj beatles could write songs everyone liked , and although xxmaj walter xxmaj hill is no mop - top he 's second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies . xxmaj the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film , the emergence of the xxmaj rapper turned movie star was in full swing , the acting took a back seat to each man 's overpowering regional accent and transparent acting . xxmaj this was one of the many ice - t movies i saw as a kid and loved , only to watch them later and cringe . xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton and xxmaj william xxmaj sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications . i hand it to xxmaj walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location . xxmaj but i fault everyone involved for turning out xxmaj lame - o performances . xxmaj ice - t and cube must have been red hot at this time , and while i 've enjoyed both their careers as rappers , in my opinion they fell flat in this movie . xxmaj it 's about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief . xxmaj now this is a movie , its not a documentary so i wo nt waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie , but there were many , and they led nowhere . i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was xxunk of confused and just playing things off the cuff . xxmaj there are two things i still enjoy about it , one involves a scene with a needle and the other is xxmaj sadler 's huge 45 pistol . xxmaj bottom line this movie is like domino 's pizza . xxmaj yeah ill eat it if i 'm hungry and i do n't feel like cooking , xxmaj but i 'm well aware it tastes like crap . 3 stars , meh .,xxbos xxmaj brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . xxmaj their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class xxup tv commercials . xxmaj but unfortunately xxmaj brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours ! xxmaj in this they fail miserably , their undeniable , but rather soft and flabby than steamy , erotic qualities non withstanding . \n",

       "  xxmaj senso ' 45 is a remake of a film by xxmaj luchino xxmaj visconti with the same title and xxmaj alida xxmaj valli and xxmaj farley xxmaj granger in the lead . xxmaj the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around xxmaj venice during the xxmaj italian wars of independence . xxmaj brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century , 1945 to be exact , so there are xxmaj mussolini murals , men in black shirts , xxmaj german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans . xxmaj but it is just window dressing , the historic context is completely negligible . \n",
